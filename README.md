    Rent DividerDo you want me to wait a bit? Probably? Give me 20 minutes, thanks a lot 
Problem/pitch: 
    Choosing an apartment is always a hassle, especially when you have multiple roommates with different living situations. This program will store the users favorite living options and calculate a fair price based off of square footage and the living situation in each room like a social room(kitchen, living room, bathrooms), a shared room(bedroom with more than one occupant), and a private room(bedroom with one occupant).
Primary stakeholder: 
    Primary users would be college students looking for a place to live and apartment searching websites.
